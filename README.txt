This is a practice project by me, It allows you register, log in and write your reviews about movies you have seen. I followed "Python Flask From Scratch" YouTube series by Brad Traversy in writing it but added features like a "search bar" and "a dashboard that only allows a logged in user to access his own reviews" which were not included in the series videos.
If you have any way of improving this, especially the frontend, you can and it would be apprieciated.
